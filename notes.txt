Issue when having fitted the model, but the np array no longer works.

""" Due to dataset manipulation, the dataframe is no longer in numpy format. Hence convert to below"""
# X_train
X_train_array = X_train.to_numpy()
X_train_new = np.array(X_train_array, order='C')

# X_test
X_test_array = X_test.to_numpy()
X_test_new = np.array(X_test_array, order='C')


Clustering:
The algorithm randomly chooses the center of data points based on their patterns within groups. If a new datapoint is introduced
the nearest center will decide to which cluster it belongs to. This will happen over and over again until the new data point
will no longer change cluster after all iterations.
